# bg-proto

Simple wrapper for some of ChatGPT features. Currently supports:

- Ask a prompt to ChatGPT
- Ask a prompt with attached image to ChatGPT (describe image, find object on image, etc)
- Ask ChatGPT to create images from a given prompt

The functions in this current project should be simple enough to use just by looking at the
function signature. You can check it yourself by looking at the ./open-ai/client.go file
